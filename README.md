## Homestay Prices Prediction Using Linear Regression

### Project Overview

This project aimed to analyze and predict the pricing trends of homestay residential properties using a linear regression model. The objective was to identify key factors influencing property prices and develop a reliable predictive model.

### Key Features

Developed a linear regression model using Python to analyze residential property pricing trends.

Achieved an R² score of 0.44–0.51 through multiple data imputation and outlier handling techniques.

Identified key factors influencing price variability, such as accommodation capacity, room types, and amenities.

### Tools and Technologies

Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Techniques:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Imputation strategies: Mean, Median, KNN

Outlier detection and handling

Feature engineering

### Steps

Data Collection: Imported raw homestay property datasets.

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and outliers using pandas and advanced imputation techniques.

EDA: Conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and correlations.

Model Building: Built and tested a linear regression model.

Result Analysis: Evaluated the model’s performance using R² scores and identified pricing trends.

### Results

The model explained 44–51% of price variability, demonstrating the importance of factors such as the number of bedrooms, cleaning fees, and room types.

Provided actionable insights into factors affecting pricing for potential property owners.
